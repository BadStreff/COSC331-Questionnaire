## Synopsis

This is a simple survey building web app for internal uses. It is based on the [Spark 2.3](http://sparkjava.com/) web framework using the [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/) template engine for the backend. The project is meant to be built with the IntelliJ IDE CE 14.1 and utilizes the maven framework for resolving dependencies.

## Motivation
